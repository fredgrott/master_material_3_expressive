# liquid_glass_demo

Dynamic stuff of Apple Liquid Glass will be tackled by the Flutter SDK team
via Flutter Impeller Engine improvements as we can only get dynamic on 
three objects via shaders currently before we start loosing frames.

So, right now we can simulate blur to bring some of liquid glass to 
Flutter. In this demo, I use Image Filter compose to adjust the default
Image Filter guassian blur to have the Apple level of saturation.
