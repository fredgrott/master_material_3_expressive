# Master Material 3 Expressive

So, I'm not waiting until late 2025 to get M3E. As it can be in fact implemented now with no fuss

In this repo is the material design 3 demo app base started with and the steps to get 
full M3E.

## Liquid Glass

The dynamic aspect of Liquid Glass is expected to be tackled by the Flutter
Impeller Engine team. However, one can simulate an Apple corrected guassian 
blur currently with no shaders required. See the liguid glass demo app source
for details, which you will find in the steps_to_m3e folder.
