# Master Material 3 Expressive

So, I'm not waiting until late 2027 to get M3E. As it can be in fact implemented now with no fuss.
Keep in mind as of now(before Material and Cupertino get separated to different packages) that 
we use the Material Design system and use Flex Color Scheme to adapt to other OS platforms.

In this repo is the material design 3 demo app base started with and the steps to get 
full M3E. The articles describing the techniques can be found at my substack:

Indirectly implied by the M3E spec but not in the Flutter SDK
